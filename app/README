-----------------------------------------

**fyi before you run the app, you might want to load it on two or more emulators,
  one for the brody cafe side, and another (or two others) for the customers. As you'll
  read later in this file, if you place an order as a customer, it locks your screen so
  you can only have one order in progress at a time (which is why you'll need the cafe
  to unlock it).


features that have been included are:
-A loading screen with a cute animation (please wait while our app loads and enjoy
 the coffee brew). This was throwing a memory error on Jerry's computer, but not on
 Abby's, Justin's and Hannah's, so if it throws an error for you, please let us know
 and switch the landing page to the LogInActivity.
-A sign up page for new customers (once the customer creates his/her account, the
 user is added to the database)
-A log in page for existing customers (clicking on "forgot password" button will
 do nothing)

    customer side (once logged in):
    -a home page:
        -if the user clicks the "+" (new order) button, he/she
         is taken to the menu page
        -clicking on any four of the "favorites" buttons will not
         do anything
        -in the top right corner there is an option to sign out, and takes user
         back to log in screen when pressed
        -in the top right corner there is a cart, which takes user to their cart
         when pressed
    -a menu page:
        -a user may click on any of the category items they see and will be taken
         to the cart when they do. Said item will be added to the bottom of the list
         on the cart pag
        -back arrow in toolbar allows the user to travel back to the home page
    -a cart page:
        -a user can click the big white "+" button below the list of items to be taken
         back to the menu page where they can select another item and add it to the list
        -a user can click the "x" button next to individual items in the list to delete
         designated item from the list
        -a user can click the "place order" button, taking them to the orders page. Upon
         click, an Order object is created and is added to the database. This order also
         gets added to the list on the cafe side
        -back arrow in toolbar goes back to the previous activity
     -an orders page:
        -this screen shows the user his/her order number
        -the back arrow in toolbar disappears until the brody cafe side swipes the order
         away (on their list), implying it was paid. The back arrow on the phone itself
         is also disabled until the order is paid
        -once the order has been paid, as indicated (swiped) by cafe, the arrows take
         the user back to the cart page

    brody cafe side (once logged in):
    -a list of orders (the cafe sees the order number, and can expand the drop
     down to see the contents of the order)
    -swipe function on each order (to the left) to delete the order from the
     list(this implies the order has just been paid)
    -swipe function removes the order from the database
    -sign out button in top right corner logs user out
